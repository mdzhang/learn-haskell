# Haskell

- *referential transparency* - if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result
- *lazy* - won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show you a result
- statically typed
- type inference - don't have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type
